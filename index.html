The data shows that SUNY post-secondary institutions witnessed fewer medical and religious vaccination exemptions than other schools across New York State.

<p> The Post-secondary Immunization Survey gathers immunization records from institutions across New York State. Throughout 2022, vaccination exemptions were recorded as medical or religious. The State University of New York drafted <a href="https://sunypoly.edu/sites/default/files/health-alerts/SUNY-COVID-Guidance-Summer-Fall-2022-2.pdf"> guidance manuals </a> that reflected the condition of COVID-19. SUNY schools across the state followed protocols that determined how vaccination exemptions for students were processed, to be approved or denied. </p>

<p>  Nurse Practitioner of Student Health at <a href="https://www.upstate.edu/"> Upstate Medical University </a> Linda Goff says that requirements were more stringent given the institution is a medical university. “We had to ensure going into clinical spaces were masked and vaccinated, so everybody would be safe.”
 </p>

 <p> As a SUNY school, Upstate followed protocols coming from the administration. “It was required for all students to be on campus, but we did have some remote campuses, and after some back and forth with New York State, they were exempted.” </p>
</div>
<p> Goff says that the exemptions process also began to change once COVID conditions did. Medical exemptions were reviewed until the vaccine mandate ended in 2023. “At first, everyone could apply for medical or religious exemption, and those were reviewed by a local board here. After a while, we stopped accepting religious exemptions.” </p>

<p> In the summer and fall of 2022, the SUNY Student COVID-19 Vaccine Policy remained effective, requiring students attending campus to show evidence of COVID-19 vaccinations. At this time, campuses continued to consider medical or religious exemption requests at the beginning of a school term. Students with approved medical or religious exemptions had mandatory surveillance testing while present on campus but were not registered for in-person classes. Institutions across NYS also had the liberty of consulting local health departments to determine the extent to which students with approved exemptions could utilize campus facilities. As a result, data on medical and religious exemptions varied across New York State.

</p>

<div class="textimage">

<p> Most of the student population at Upstate was very good with getting vaccinated, said Goff.While percentages of exemptions for SUNY schools were near zero, other private institutions recorded high rates of exemptions. Outliers such as Davis College, Fei Tian College, and Holy Trinity Orthodox Seminary all have religious affiliations and soaring numbers of religious vaccination exemptions. </p>

<p> The religious or scientific nature of a university or college could reflect in high or low vaccination rates. While Upstate, a medical university, evidences low vaccination rates, the institutions with the highest rates have some type of theological association. </p>

<p> As of the fall semester of 2023, approximately <a href="https://www.suny.edu/media/suny/content-assets/documents/health-alert/Updated-COVID-Policy-Guidance-072823.pdf"> 77.9% </a>  of 18–25-year-olds and 80.1% of 26–34-year-olds had completed their primary series vaccinations in New York State. New protocols were established as COVID conditions changed, and the public health emergency officially ended on May 11, 2023. Vaccinations were no longer required for enrollment, but boosters were still encouraged for all campuses. Institutions could still maintain specific requirements or get rid of others. Campuses were no longer required to report the vaccine status of all enrolled students to SUNY System Administration.
</p>
</div>
<p> Students were encouraged to stay updated with COVID-19 boosters, but SUNY did not impose requirements for any booster. Campuses could, however, impose additional vaccination requirements at their discretion. Post-secondary institutions were required to continue reporting data on vaccination and exemptions.  </p>
